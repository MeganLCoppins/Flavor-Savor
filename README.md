# Flavor Savor

In this project our team created a web based app called Flavor Savor that finds a recipe based on what food item the user inputs and it displays a number of recipes

GIVEN a recipe dashboard with form
WHEN I search for a specific food item (ex: chicken)
THEN I am presented with recipes with that item included in ingredient list 
WHEN I view recipe results 
THEN I am presented with the name of the recipe, picture of recipe and a link to view the recipe 
WHEN I view a recipe I have an option to save the recipe
THEN the saved recipe is added to list of favorite recipes 
WHEN I click on favorite recipes link
THEN I am presented with list of saved recipes
